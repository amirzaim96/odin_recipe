            <h2>Follow the instruction:</h2>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tablespoon packed brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                    <li>4 pounds beef short ribs (bone-in), trimmed of fat</li>
                    <li>Reynolds Wrap® Heavy Duty Aluminum Foil</li>
                    <li>½ cup barbecue sauce, plus additional for serving</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Instruction</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix brown sugar, paprika, chili powder, salt, and garlic powder in a medium bowl.</li>
                    <li>Cut ribs into equal portions. Generously rub spice mixture onto all surfaces of ribs; place ribs in a single layer in a glass baking dish. Cover and refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>Preheat grill to medium indirect heat, 375 to 400 degrees F (190 to 200 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Center one portion ribs on a 12x18-inch sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil; add 2 ice cubes. Bring up the foil sides, then double-fold the top and ends to seal the packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside. Repeat to make 3 more packets.</li>
                    <li>Arrange packets over indirect heat on the preheated grill. Cover and cook until tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours</li>
                    <li>Uncover the grill. Keeping the foil packets on the grill, open them carefully by cutting along the top folds with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape; then proceed to open packets fully.</li>
                    <li>Brush ribs with about 1/2 cup barbecue sauce.</li>
                    <li>Move packets over direct heat, cover, and continue grilling, turning once, until ribs are browned and crisp, about 5 minutes more.</li>
                    <li>Serve with additional barbecue sauce as desired.</li>
